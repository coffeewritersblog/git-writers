Kopito is a 48-year-old Japanese archaeologist.
He is 5 foot 7 inches tall, has a fair face and wears thick spectacles. His hair is long and graying.

He prefers having his tea without milk or sugar, reads 20 pages of a book the first thing before he gets out of bed, and keeps away from technology.

He has a phone that can only make and receive calls. Kopito loves collecting coins and has a vast collection of coins from all over the world, some "borrowed", some stolen.

Kopito has no wife or children and travels frequently. His travel bag consists of a shaving kit, two pairs each of a shirt, a pant, innerwear and socks.

Kopito puts more pressure on his left leg when walking due to a knee injury he suffered to his right leg during an excavation twelve years ago. He refused a surgery citing that he prefers things the way they are unless they get completely out of hand.

You could call Kopito a rich man, but his way of living is frugal. The books he buys on his travels are shipped back to his house in Japan where he has created a library for himself in his living room.

Kopito's biggest fear is not being able to sustain himself.
